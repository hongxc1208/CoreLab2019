			<p>The little scientist and Lil D enter the room and to their suprise they see a enclosure of weak looking alien beings. The little scientist is filed with fear. He moves towards the barrier and looks at the creatures with disbelief. He hears the door shut behind him. The room becomes pitch black. He hear the alien's disembodied voice echo in the room. "I see you've joined my collection of organisms, your energy will be put to good use." The alien voice cus off and all the LS can hear is the murmurs of the trapped aliens. Lil D gives a low battery signal then immediately shuts off. </p>
