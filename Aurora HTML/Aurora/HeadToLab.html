			<p>The mob of aliens and little scientist see the Evil Creature trying to run the energy processor. The evil creature heads to the Energy chamber where the aliens were imprisoned. Lil D and the little scientist follow closely behind him. They push the evil creature into the chamber and lock it from the outside. The aliens turn on the energy processor and the sky brightens. A sphere rises into the sky and is flooded with light.
			The sky brightens with colorful lights. The arid landscape comes back to life and all the plants grow back. A beautiful aurora fills the sky and the aliens celebrate their missions's success! "</p>
