			<p>The alien brings LS and his companion to the planets EnviroLab. It's where the energy used to power their civilization is stored and used. It looks run down and dingy. The lab gives the LS aneerie feeling, it doesn't feel as inviting as his fathers lab back on Earth. Lil D tells LS that he's low on battery and needs to charge.  </p>
