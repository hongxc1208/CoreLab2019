			<p>The Strange Creature explains how his planet would collect energy from their sun and use it to run their cities. One day, the people of their planet faced a scarcity of resources. It became too difficult for everyday aliens to live. Only the prosperous aliens could afford the left over resources. Once they sucked the planet dry, the wealthy beings fled to seek better living oppurtunities and the remaining aliens parished.   </p>
