			<p>The Alien Creature explained how he's able to harvest just enough energy for him to survive and continue research in hopes of bringing the planet back to life. "Well how do manage to do that without resources?" asks Lil D. The alien looked at the robot with annoyence. "I harvest energy from the few remaining organisms I managed to save before our planet became arid."
			The little scientist wasn't sure what the alien meant by this but he became uneasy. Lil D senses the little scienstist's apprehension. "Maybe we should seek an exit."  </p>
