			<p>The strange being rises from his sleeping pod. He looks at the little scientist with a perplexed and curious look on his face. He asks the young boy what he's doing so far from home. The LS explains that he comes from Earth and is doing research for his father. The alien explains how his planet came to be a barren wasteland. HE is the only remaining life form. He asks the LS to help him restore his planet to its former glory.  </p>
