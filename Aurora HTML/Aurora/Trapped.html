			<p>The little scientist and his companion have sccesfully fled the lab of the evil Alien. LS panics looking for a way to leave the Desert. He makes his way back to the sleeping pod hoping to reopen the portal some how. Lil D tells the young scientist "I can't seem to find a way to reopen the wormhole" The little scientist's breath speeds up with anxiety. He hears a crowd of voices approaching them. "Oh dear, looks like we're going to have to alert your father." Lil D rings the Ls's father and explains the situation. The little scientist's father scolds with him ager and opens the wormhole from the lab back on Earth. As they prepare to leave through the wormhole The LS sees a group of unidentified aliens approach from behind. "Please take us with you" one of them begs. The little scientist enters the wormhole with his companion and they don't look back. </p>
